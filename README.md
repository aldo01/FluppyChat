# FluppyChat

It's my course project for subject "Архітектура програмного забезпечення"

This app is mobile messanger, like "whats app" or "viber". But with small modification. I added new essence "room".
Room is place where people can speaking in groups.

Currently, only android, version done. In future I plan add iOS version, social auth and photo for user.

## Authenfication

When user open app, they can see authenfication page. Here user can login or sign up.
